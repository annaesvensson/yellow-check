## How to find broken links

You can find broken links at the [command line](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core). It is quite normal for pages to be renamed, files to be removed and links to no longer work. Donâ€™t worry, it's not hard to find broken links. Open a terminal window. Go to your installation folder, where the file `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php check`, you can optionally add a folder and a location. This will find broken links. Edit the pages shown, fix the broken links and execute the command again.

If you don't want that a page is checked, set `Generate: exclude` in the [page settings](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core#settings-page) at the top of a page.

## Examples

Content file with option for generating a static website:

    ---
    Title: Example page
    Generate: exclude
    ---
    This page is not checked for broken links.

Finding broken links at the command line:

`php yellow.php check`
